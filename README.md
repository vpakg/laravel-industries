# laravel-industries
Laravel Industries is a bundle that creates migrations and seeds it with industries and economic sectors following the [International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC rev 4)](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/isic-4.asp).

Based and inspired by [webpatser/laravel-countries](https://github.com/webpatser/laravel-countries)

IMPORTANT
---------
I'm first storing the files here, will later transform this into a full package with migrations, seeds and models.
